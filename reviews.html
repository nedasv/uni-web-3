                    Between massive leaks, rumors, and even FBI investigations, the story of how GTA 6 has been going on long before there was any official announcement. Now that we have confirmation that a Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer is coming in early December, let’s take a look at everything we know so far It’s been nearly a decade since the first launch of Grand Theft Auto 5, and we already know a lot about the sequel before we’ve ever seen official footage. According to now pretty well-substantiated rumors, there seems to be two playable bank robber protagonists (one male and one female) in the style of Bonnie and Clyde. The rumored location also seems to be Miami, just like Vice City, with more locations to be added at a later date.

                    Luigi's Mansion for 3DS Review
            </button>

            <div class="wrapper6">
                <p>
                    Luigi's Mansion's gameplay is entertaining but simple: Enter a new area, use detection gear and wits to solve a mystery, fight a mini-boss ghost, loot the room, and move on. I enjoyed many of the distinctive encounters that invited me to overcome gravity-flipping puzzles, utilize mirrors to detect invisible enemies, and manipulate environments to render ghosts vulnerable. But not all of the challenges are equal. Catching ghosts in Luigi's mansion required me to overcome puzzles that ranged between simple-but-satisfying to slightly irritating. Clues were ample and there was never a moment that defied all logic -- but I did occasionally find myself just banging on things hoping something would happen. I also didn't particularly enjoy the rare moments when I was forced to backtrack, heading for a life refill or trying to locate a wardrobe I'd last seen hours before.

                    Lethal Company reviewed in Early Access by Gabriel Moss on PC. There’s nothing quite like a multiplayer survival-horror game that’s as unceasingly spooky as it is hilariously chaotic – and there are few that manage to balance horror and comedy as well as Lethal Company. Even in its early access phase, this co-op loot hunt manages to transcend its limited content and missing systems, making it a good time for those willing to brave its haunted halls – especially with the volume turned up. Still, there’s no real story to speak of, and its tension is deflated a bit by an unappealing and jankily animated art style, overused dungeon templates, and an unrealized progression system that feels as cold and lifeless as the void. We can expect to see a lot of that get improved on during early access, of course.

                    Assassin's Creed Nexus VR
                </button>
    <br>
                <div class="wrapper8">
                    <p>
                        Even way back in 2007 when we entered the Animus for the first time in the original Assassin’s Creed, who among us never imagined the day we’d be able to enter the same virtual world as Desmond Miles to do battle with Templars? Well, we may not be dangling from a giant robot tentacle like Michael Fassbender just yet, but with Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR we’re at least one step closer to that Holy Grail. Thankfully, the series’ first crack at VR is largely a success, providing an unexpectedly complete Assassin’s Creed adventure (currently exclusive to the Meta Quest 2/3/Pro) that nails parkour and stealth, and even has a decent story to boot. It’s Ubisoft’s most immersive Assassin’s Creed game ever, and although there are plenty of areas in need of improvement, from the dull and unremarkable combat to technical issues and blurry characters, the vast majority of my time seeing through the eyes of an Assassin was well spent.
                        Nexus is an action-adventure game that recreates every part of the traditional Assassin’s Creed experience in virtual reality, and that never stops being an impressive feat, even when some of those elements don’t end up working super well from this perspective. One moment you’re channeling your inner Assassin as you parkour across rooftops in Venice, the next you’re battling with sluggish Spartans in ancient Athens, and the next you’re tailing someone through the streets of Boston in colonial America. The roughly 15-hour campaign feels every bit as fleshed out as any non-VR game in the series (give or take a few dozen hours of bloat), complete with optional historical trivia collectibles and minigame challenges like parkour time trials and archery target practice. It’s downright impressive just how much of the Assassin’s Creed format the developers managed to pack into the wire-free Quest 3.
